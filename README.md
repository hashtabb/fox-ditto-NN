# slippi-melee-analyzerNN
## Goal:
Being able to definitely generate which player has an advantageous state at any point in time during a game. 

## Data:
Using 5700 games played at Smash Summit 12 - these games consists almost exclusively of top players, or those with considerable experience in melee.

## Roadmap:
- [ ] function to extract player states at various positions in time from slippi files
- [ ] function to analyze all slippi files in directory
- [ ] function to objectively determine "player advantage" at a given point in time (might need multiple)
- [ ] function to create test data / training data split
